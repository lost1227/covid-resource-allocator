1. As a local town representative, I want to inform about updates
on my community so that the community can stay informed about new 
policies and regulations.
2. As a business owner, I want to provide information on available
jobs so that those unemployed can find work.
3. As a restaurant owner, I want to provide discounted foods or
donations so that people know where food is available.
